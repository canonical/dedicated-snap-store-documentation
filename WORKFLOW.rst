Workflow
********

This repository builds public documentation for the Dedicated Snap Store, and
private documentation configured for specific customers. It is recommended to
build customer specific onboarding documentation locally, as building through
RTD requires additional configuration.

Generating documentation locally
================================

Documentation can be generated locally using the template files. Simply set the
``TEMPLATE`` variable when calling ``make``. For example, to create a PDF of the
``acme-alpha`` template use the following command:

.. code-block:: none

    make pdf TEMPLATE="templates/acme-alpha.yaml"

.. note::

    Local generation of PDF files requires some system packages. You will be
	prompted to use ``sudo make pdf-prep-force`` to install the required packages if
	they are not found on your system.

New customers
=================

Setting up the Dedicated Snap Store documentation for a new customer involves
the Store team creating and configuring a new project on ReadTheDocs and Field
Engineering filling in a template containing customer-specific values.

These instructions assume that you have the proper permissions under the GitHub
and ReadTheDocs projects.

Store Team
----------

1. Create a new project on Read The Docs under the Canonical organization.
#. Go to https://readthedocs.com/organizations/canonical/, click the project,
	click the "Admin" tab.
#. Change the "Repository URL" to
	``git@github.com:canonical/brand-store-documentation.git`` and click "Save".
#. Click on "Environment Variables", click on "Add Environment
	Variable"; fill in "Name" with ``TEMPLATE_FILENAME``, value with
	``templates/<template-filename>``, and click "Save".

   - The template filename can really be anything unique, but ideally is of the
		form ``company-brand.yaml``. For example, the example Acme company has a brand
		named Alpha and so the template filename is ``acme-alpha.yaml``.

#. Click on "SSH Keys", click the displayed key, and add the public key to the
	https://github.com/canonical/brand-store-documentation GitHub repository; the
	key only requires Read permissions.
#. Click on "Integrations", click on "GitHub incoming webhook", click "Resync
	webhook"
#. Create a new file under the ``templates/`` directory in the
	``canonical/brand-store-documentation`` repository with a filename that matches
	the filename used above.

Field Engineering
-----------------

1. Create a copy of ``templates/TEMPLATE.yaml`` and rename it to create a file
	for a specific customer.
#. Replace the values in the template file with the correct values for the brand
	that is being created.

Updating existing documentation
===============================

Updating existing documentation for Dedicated Snap Store customers requires
editing the reStructuredText source code in the GitHub repository and then
downloading the generated PDF from ReadTheDocs.

Field Engineering
-----------------

1. On the webpage corresponding to the part of the documentation you wish to
	edit, click the pen icon next to the "Give feedback" button. Alternatively,
	clone the repository from GitHub, make the changes, and manually create a pull
	request.
#. Make the necessary changes.
#. Submit a PR with the changes.
#. A few automated checks will run for the PR. Once those checks complete, and
	assuming the changes can be cleanly merged, click on the "Merge" button to merge
	the pull request.
#. Wait for the documentation to rebuild.
#. Go to the generated PDF document located at
	``https://canonical-<readthedocs-project-name>.readthedocs-hosted.com/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/``
	and download the PDF.

   - Downloading the generated PDFs is currently a manual process which must be
		done for each Dedicated Snap Store customer when the documentation is updated.

Creating a new documentation page
=================================

To create a new documentation page, create a new ``*.rst`` document in the root
directory of the Git repository and add the new document to the ``toctree`` at
https://github.com/canonical/brand-store-documentation/blob/main/index.rst.

The PDF is generated with a separate index file, so any additional
pages will need to be added to the main ``docs/index.rst`` file, and the
``docs/pdf-index.rst`` file if you wish for the page to be included in the
onboarding guide.

Adding a new template variable
==============================

New template variables can be created by adding the variable and its default
value to ``templates/TEMPLATE.yaml``. Customer values are defined in the
corresponding template. For example, ``templates/acme-alpha.yaml`` defines the
Acme Alpha example store with entries including:

.. code-block:: yaml

    CUSTOMER_STORE_ID: "acme-store"
    CUSTOMER_STORE_NAME: "Alpha 3"

Variables can then be used in pages by wrapping the variable name in ``{{}}``,
for example, ``{{CUSTOMER_STORE_NAME}}``.
