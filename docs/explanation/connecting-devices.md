Ubuntu Core devices are onboarded to their owner’s Dedicated Snap Store in
a secure manner. Secure onboarding prevents unauthorized access to private
software and services. It also establishes a secure communication link between
devices and their cloud backend.

Secure device onboarding is a four stage process that starts with a request for
serial keys, proceeds with device initialization from the cloud, and ends with
device authentication and authorization. The first two stages are handled by the
Model Service which is a service that issues credentials to devices.

## Device initialization

The secure onboarding process starts at first boot. When turned on for the
first time, an Ubuntu Core device uses its private key, its serial number, and
its owner’s ID to send a request for a serial assertion to a specified Model
Service, which is hosted by Canonical. The Model Service processes the request,
and, if the device’s public key is stored in the Model Service, a [serial assertion](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/core/reference/assertions/serial/)
is issued as response to the request. The serial assertion issued by the Serial
Vault is then stored on the device.

## Authentication and authorization

Both the serial and the [model](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/core/reference/assertions/model/)
assertions will be used by devices to access your Dedicated Snap Store. Devices
will use these secure documents to initiate a handshake with your store. The
Dedicated Snap Store authenticates the keys and authorizes the device.
